today we started with the margin and padding. 
margin --> outside the box 
padding --> inside the box . 

padding is a inner thing and margin is outer thing . 


20 px --> exactly what it says . 
20 % --> relative to the size of screen .. 

we are done with the margin and padding parts today and also looked at the box model. 
overall preety good session .
