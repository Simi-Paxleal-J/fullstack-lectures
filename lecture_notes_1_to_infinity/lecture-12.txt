3,4th were holidays but we had dom manipulation lecture . 
getelements_by_id(element)
get_elements_by_classNAME(element)
same for tag name . 

_________________________________________________________
querySelector()----> basically all in one , but gets the first one not all of them . zeroth index selector 
qs(".classname")
qs("#idname)
qs("tag")
changing html tag is possible using querySelector possibly.
